## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell.
3. The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.
4. The first player to get three in a row wins. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
